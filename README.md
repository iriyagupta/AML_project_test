# TITLE : MUSIC GENRE CLASSIFICATION


Music moves us all, and has no boundaries â€“ figuratively and literally. As humans, we tend to classify music as belonging to various genres, such as Pop, Rock, Blues, Jazz, Electronic Dance Music, Classical Music, and quite a few more. This classification is often multi-class, and multi-bin, in that a given song could fall into more than one genre. For example, a given song could be classified both as a Rock and Pop song, or, another song could be classified both as Electronic and Synthpop. 

There have been several deep learning and machine learning algorithms for the task of the Music Genre Classification [MGR]. There are several applications of MGR which includes music therapy for autism, generation of the similar kind of music with the help of genre etc. In this project, we plan to implement a machine learning algorithm that allows us to perform the task of MGR effectively and generate similar results as the current state-of-the-art methods, along with letting us demonstrate our  learnings from the course.
